<h1>Dan Leyzberg</h1>
<p>Hello! I am a third-year <a href="http://www.cs.yale.edu">computer science</a> graduate student, advised by <a href="http://cs.yale.edu/~scaz">Brian Scassellati</a>.</p>
<h2>Research</h2>
<p>I make computational models of personality.</p>
<p>My aim is to engender a rich human-robot experience. There can be no doubt that characters engage us; from talking cartoon mice to the people portrayed on your favorite television show, we watch and connect with characters -- ones whose personalities and stories we enjoy. I attempt to build robotic characters that keep people engaged.</p>
<p>Education and therapy.
	
	to Desperate Housewives, The personality of a character is a major factor in engaging people. As we build robots that people are meant to interact with, we stand to benefit from getting people more interested in working with a robot. I'm interested, specifically, in the potential contributions of a robot's model of emotion and/or personality to producing richer human-robot interaction. I use what psychology has illuminated about human nature as a starting point to my work, to equip a robot with believable emotional responses. 
	
	The long term vision of this line of research is to better engage patients in socially-assistive robotic therapies.</p>

<h2>Teaching</h2>
<p>I also thoroughly enjoy teaching; I teach an AP Computer Science class and Introduction to Computer Science class at <a href="http://www.hamdenhall.org">Hamden Hall Country Day School</a>. In 2008, I presented a <a href="http://nifty.stanford.edu/2008/leyzberg-simon-asteroids/">"Nifty Assignment"</a> at <a href="http://www.cs.duke.edu/sigcse08/">SIGCSE</a>, teaching object oriented programming decision-making by developing an Asteroids game.</p>
